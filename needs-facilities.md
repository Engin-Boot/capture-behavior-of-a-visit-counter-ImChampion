# Visit-counter for a Facilities Manager

Scenario: Report visitor trends during a week of operation

Given I have the count of visitors visiting hospital on each day of week.

and the count of doctors and nurses should also be more than ordinary days.
Then the visitors would have good experience with hospital.

Scenario: Alert when seating capacity is full.
